        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups cold, cooked white rice</li>
            <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
            <li>Lots of garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, break cold rice to separate grains.</li>
            <li>In a wide skillet over low heat, heat about ¼ cup oil. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally until golden brown. With a slotted spoon, remove the garlic and drain on paper towels. </li>
            <li>Remove excess oil except for about 1 to 2 tablespoons. Raise heat to high, swirling the oil to coat the surface of the pan. </li>
            <li>Add rice and cook, spreading on the surface of the pan for about 45 seconds or until grains start to sizzle and then toss to redistribute. Repeat a few times until rice is heated through.</li>
            <li>Return ¾ of the garlic and toss with the fried rice until evenly distributed. </li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
            <li>To serve, transfer to a serving platter and top with the remaining garlic bits.</li>
        </ol>
